            <p>Prof. Billard and his co-partner, Prof. Jose del R. Milan, have collaborated to develop an innovative computer program. This program enables the control of a robotic machine using signals transmitted directly from the human brain. By utilizing electrical signals generated by the brain, the program establishes a connection between the researcher's thoughts and the robotic machine. Moreover, the algorithm  incorporated in the program possesses the ability to learn and adapt based on the researcher's cognitive thoughts. </p>
